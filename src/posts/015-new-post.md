# WH40k Darktide: Biggest Coward

The squad plunged into the underhive, a blur of fire and psychic screams. Two psykers crackled with warp-light, a zealot roared hymns through a storm of gore—and behind them, **Rukk** shuffled, eyes wide, ripper gun clutched like a child’s toy.  

He did not fight. He never fought. Every time enemies appeared, he hid. Shadows became his shield; corners became his refuge.  

> “Not me… not me…” he whispered, again and again, as the screams of his squad filled the tunnels.  

The psykers cursed him. The zealot spat holy venom at him. But Rukk never faltered in his cowardice. Survival mattered, and the rest did not.

When the horde swarmed them in the reactor’s heart, the zealot fell, chainsword broken. The psykers burned themselves out, bodies smoking with warp-backlash. And Rukk? He tried to hide, tried to crawl, tried to survive.  

But there was nowhere to run. Bullets tore through walls, heretic blades found gaps in the rubble, and Rukk’s massive frame finally fell.  

His last breath was not brave. His last scream was of terror.  

When the dust settled, all four were dead. The squad had perished together, and Rukk, the coward to his bones, had died exactly as he had lived: hiding, useless, and afraid.
