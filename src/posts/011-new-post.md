### COLLAPSE MACHINE — Devblog

A quick look at what we built and polished this week.

### Highlights

- **Respawn feels reliable**: Coming back after defeat now spawns a fresh body and properly cleans up the old one. Visual effects load correctly after respawn, reducing odd lighting or post‑process issues.

- **Smoother saving and loading**: The save system was reorganized behind the scenes to make it more robust and easier to extend. This sets us up for safer updates to player data and faster loads.

- **Clearer combat feedback**: There’s a new on‑screen health bar for the player. It’s easier to read your status during fights and react accordingly.

- **More stable movement and physics**: We tightened up how moving objects behave (especially over the network) and improved how the world handles very large distances. Expect fewer jittery moments and better stability in big spaces.

- **Sharper AI reactions**: Enemies transition into ragdoll states more smoothly, and weapon collisions feel more consistent. Health behavior on AI has been tuned to reduce unexpected spikes or stalls in combat.

- **UI quality of life**: Chat and interaction UIs received polish. Inventory interactions are more predictable and there are small quality‑of‑life improvements across the HUD.

- **Content cleanup and branding**: We removed a handful of deprecated items and added fresh branding visuals in preparation for store presence.

### What this unlocks next

- **Edge‑case respawns**: Test across scene changes, network reconnects, and late‑joining players.
- **Save data evolution**: Add versioning and migration so future updates to saves are seamless.
- **Combat readability**: Damage indicators and low‑health cues to complement the new health bar.
- **AI performance pass**: Profile ragdoll activation and collision handling in larger fights.
- **Content hygiene**: Keep pruning unused content and validating references.
